Pyndex is  a python learning game. It will work like game of index cards.

Pyndex will have engine that will force player through learning material.

Game has a "Truthtable" section in which all the boolean logic possibilities will be presented one by one,
and the right answer will be shown after user guess input. Input is "truth" or "false". after list is exhausted,
game will promt for a choise to move on to next section or try "truthtable" again.

Second section or phase is  a "Dictionary" it will show keywords and data types in sequence.
within sequence words will be random. game could show limited amount of diffferent words each time. when
word limit is reached game will promt for replay or next episode.

third section is "string formats and escapes". It will show strings or escapes, and ask for proper answer. answer is printed
after the input. section can be reversed to show description and prompt for a string or escape.

Last section is python "phrase drill" from textbook.

Section can be accessed in any random order and be played multiple times. counter could be included to calculate correct
answer and maybe show statistics. questions and answer will be from textfiles.
